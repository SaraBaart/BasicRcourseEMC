## Markdown: Questions

We are going to do an analysis in R using quatro to produce an html file that contains both the code and the results. To help you on your way you can use the file practicaltemplate.qmd that you can find on Canvas.

### Question 1
We are going to explore the build-in data set 'ToothGrowth' that is beging loaded in the setup chuck of the template document. In the second chunk we create histograms for the length of the teeth given the dose and the supplement given. If needed go back to the chapter about creating plots to find information on how to do this.
